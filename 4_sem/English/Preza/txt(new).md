# **Report on the Topic: "Types of Cyber Threats and Protection Methods"**  

## **Introduction**  
With the advancement of digital technologies, cyber threats have become increasingly diverse and dangerous. Every year, businesses and individual users face millions of cyberattacks, leading to financial losses, personal data breaches, and even the paralysis of critical infrastructure.  

The purpose of this report is to examine the main types of cyber threats, their consequences, and the most effective protection methods.

## **1. Main Types of Cyber Threats**  

### **1.1. Malware**  
**Malware** is a general term for malicious software, including viruses, trojans, worms, and ransomware.  

- **Viruses** — embed themselves into legitimate files and spread when executed.  
- **Trojans** — disguise themselves as useful programs but steal data or provide system access.  
- **Ransomware** (e.g., WannaCry) — encrypts files and demands a ransom for decryption.  
- **Worms** — self-propagate across networks without user interaction.  

**Consequences:** Data loss, financial damage, system disruption.  

### **1.2. Phishing and Social Engineering**  
Phishing is a method of deceiving users to steal login credentials, passwords, or money.  

- **Email phishing** — fake emails from banks, social networks, or colleagues.  
- **Smishing** — fraudulent SMS with malicious links.  
- **Vishing** — phone calls from fake "tech support."  

### **1.3. DoS/DDoS Attacks**  
**DoS (Denial of Service)** — an attack aimed at overwhelming a server with requests.  
**DDoS (Distributed DoS)** — an attack launched from multiple devices (botnet).  

**Consequences:** Website and online service outages, financial losses.  

### **1.4. Software Vulnerabilities and Zero-Day Exploits**  
**Zero-day** — attacks exploiting unknown vulnerabilities before patches are released.  

### **1.5. Data Breaches**  
Theft of corporate databases (logins, passwords, payment details).

## **2. Protection Methods**  

### **2.1. Technical Measures**  
- **Antivirus and firewalls** (Kaspersky, Bitdefender).  
- **Software updates** — patching vulnerabilities.  
- **Data encryption** (VPN, SSL/TLS).  
- **Intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).** 

### **2.2. DDoS Protection**  
- Using CDN (Cloudflare).  
- Traffic filtering.

## **Conclusion**  
Cyber threats pose a serious risk to both businesses and individuals. Effective protection requires a comprehensive approach:  

1. **Technical solutions** (antivirus, updates).  
2. **Training** for staff and users.  
3. **Monitoring** and rapid incident response.  

Only a combination of these measures can minimize risks in the face of growing cybercrime.  

**Stay vigilant and practice good cyber hygiene!**

### Extended Presentation Notes  
**Topic:** "Malware and Cybercrime" and "Data Security"  

---  

#### Slide 1: Introduction  
**Presentation Objectives:**  
In today’s digital world, cyber threats are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and data protection is more critical than ever. This presentation aims to:  
1. **Explore types of malware** and cybercrime techniques.  
2. **Analyze modern data security technologies**, including encryption, authentication, and backups.  
3. **Develop practical skills** for personal and corporate cybersecurity.  

**Relevance of the Topic:**  
According to research, cybercrime caused over $8 trillion in damages in 2023. Over 300,000 new malware samples are detected daily.

#### Slide 2: Unit 5 – Malware and Cybercrime  
**1. Key Concepts**  
- **Malware** (malicious software) — programs designed to cause harm:  
  - *Example:* The WannaCry virus (2017) infected 200,000 computers across 150 countries.  
- **Cybercrime** — criminal activities in the digital space:  
  - *Example:* Phishing attacks account for 80% of all security incidents.  

**2. Types of Malware**  
| Type          | Characteristics                                  | Example               |  
|--------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------|  
| **Viruses**   | Infect files, require user activation         | Melissa (1999)       |  
| **Worms**    | Self-replicate via networks                   | ILOVEYOU (2000)      |  
| **Trojans**   | Disguised as legitimate software              | Emotet               |  
| **Ransomware**| Encrypts data and demands ransom              | NotPetya (2017)      |  
| **Spyware**  | Steals data (passwords, bank details)        | Pegasus              |  

**3. Cybercrimes**  
- **Phishing:** Fake emails from "banks" with links to fraudulent websites.  
  - *Statistic:* 65% of attacks use social engineering.  
- **DDoS Attacks:** Botnets (e.g., Mirai) overwhelm servers, causing outages.  
- **Salami Attacks:** Theft of micro-amounts (e.g., rounding fractional cents).

#### Slide 3: Unit 6 – Data Security  
**1. Data Protection Methods**  
- **Antivirus Software:**  
  - *How it works:* Signature analysis + heuristic scanning.  
  - *Top solutions:* Kaspersky, Norton, Bitdefender.  
- **Firewalls:**  
  - *Functions:* Blocks suspicious IPs and ports.  
  - *Example:* Windows Defender Firewall.  
- **Encryption:**  
  - **AES-256** (government standard) vs. **RSA** (for digital signatures).  
- **Backups:**  
  - 3-2-1 Rule: 3 copies, 2 storage types, 1 offsite.  

**2. Authentication Technologies**  
- **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication):**  
  - Combines password + SMS + biometrics.  
  - *Example:* Google Authenticator.  
- **Biometrics:**  
  - Face ID (Apple) accuracy: 1 error per 1 million attempts.  

**3. Threats and Countermeasures**  
| Threat               | Protection                          |  
|----------------------|---------------------------------|  
| Brute Force          | 12+ character passwords + lockout after 5 attempts |  
| CAPTCHA              | reCAPTCHA v3 (behavioral analysis) |  
| Software Vulnerabilities | Automatic updates (e.g., Windows Update) |

#### Slide 4: Unit 5 vs. Unit 6 Comparison  
| Criterion             | Unit 5 (Malware and Cybercrime)       | Unit 6 (Data Security)           |  
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------|  
| **Focus**            | Threat analysis                       | Defense tools                    |  
| **Key Examples**     | Viruses, phishing, DDoS               | Firewalls, AES, MFA              |  
| **Goal**            | Risk awareness                        | Developing protection skills     |  

**Conclusion:** The two units are interconnected—understanding threats (Unit 5) motivates the adoption of safeguards (Unit 6).

#### Slide 5: Practical Recommendations  
**For Users:**  
1. **Malware Prevention:**  
   - Avoid opening attachments from unknown senders.  
   - Verify website domains (e.g., `bank.ru` vs. `b4nk.ru`).  
2. **Data Protection:**  
   - Use password managers (LastPass, 1Password).  
   - Enable cloud backups (Google Drive, iCloud).  

**For Organizations:**  
- Deploy **SIEM systems** (e.g., Splunk) for threat monitoring.  
- Conduct **cyber hygiene training** for employees.  

**If Attacked:**  
1. Immediately disconnect the device from the network.  
2. Report to the IT security team or CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team).

#### Slide 6: Conclusion  
**Key Takeaways:**  
1. Cybercriminals continuously evolve their methods—from trojans to AI-driven phishing.  
2. Modern technologies (MFA, biometrics, Zero Trust) significantly reduce risks.  

**Call to Action:**  
- Update software regularly.  
- Attend cybersecurity webinars (e.g., by Kaspersky or Cisco).  

**Thank you for your attention! Questions are welcome.**

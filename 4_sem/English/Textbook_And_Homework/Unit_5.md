### **Task 11. Speaking – Discuss with a partner**

(Пример ответа, если нужно будет говорить устно или писать кратко):

**What would you do if you received an email attachment from an unknown sender?**  
> I wouldn’t open it. First, I’d check the sender’s email address and see if it looks suspicious. Then I’d scan the attachment with antivirus software. If I wasn’t expecting anything, I’d probably just delete the email.

**Have you ever had a virus on your computer? What happened?**

WannaCry is a type of ransomware that spread across the world in May 2017. It affected over 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries. The malware encrypted users’ files and demanded payment in Bitcoin to unlock them. It exploited a Windows vulnerability called EternalBlue. Hospitals, banks, and government institutions were hit. The attack caused billions in damage. It was eventually stopped by a cybersecurity researcher who discovered a "kill switch" in the code. WannaCry showed how important it is to keep software up to date and have good backups.

**How to Protect Your Computer from Malware**

In today’s digital world, protecting your computer from malware is essential. First of all, install reliable antivirus software and keep it up to date. Antivirus programs help detect and remove malicious software before it can cause harm.

Secondly, avoid opening email attachments or clicking on links from unknown sources. Many viruses spread through email or infected websites. Always double-check the source before downloading anything.

Also, keep your operating system and software updated. Developers regularly release security patches that fix vulnerabilities malware can exploit.

Finally, back up your data regularly. If your system is infected, you won’t lose important files.

By following these steps, you can reduce the risk of infection and keep your computer safe from threats.

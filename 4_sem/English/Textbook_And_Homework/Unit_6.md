1. **What is the main purpose of the email?**  
   - **b) to help clients keep their information secure** *(Most likely, as companies often send security advisories.)*  

2. **How can users be sure they are on the official Safeguard site?**  
   - **c) by verifying the URL** *(Checking the website address is a standard security practice.)*  

3. **How did hackers infect customers' computers with malware?**  
   - **b) by attaching spyware to a download** *(A common method is disguising malware in fake downloads.)*  

*(For exact answers, listening to Audio File 6.1 is necessary.)*

### **Task 4. Read Text A and Choose the Correct Answers**  

#### **Text A: The Firewall**  
*(Summary of key points)*  
- Firewalls work using different methods, often combining them.  
- **Packet filtering**: Data is split into packets, inspected, and filtered based on user settings.  
- Filters can block domains, IP addresses, or specific keywords.  
- Default settings are usually sufficient, but users can create exceptions for unauthorized programs.  

#### **Questions & Answers:**  

1. **What is the main purpose of the article?**  
   - **c) to clarify information about firewalls** *(The text explains how firewalls work, focusing on packet filtering and settings.)*  

2. **Which of the following is NOT one of the steps of packet filtering?**  
   - **b) The network administrator decides to reject or permit the communication.** *(The firewall itself makes this decision, not the admin, unless manually configured.)*  

3. **Why would a user create an exception?**  
   - **a) to allow communication from a particular program** *(Exceptions let specific programs bypass the firewall without lowering overall security.)*

### **Task 7. Video Summary: Firewalls**  
*(Based on the video: [https://youtu.be/kDEX1HXybrU])*  

1. **What is the role of a firewall?**  
   - To monitor and control incoming/outgoing network traffic based on security rules, acting as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks.  

2. **Why is a network firewall associated with a building’s firewall?**  
   - Both act as protective barriers—a building’s firewall prevents fire from spreading, while a network firewall blocks malicious traffic.  

3. **What specialist in a company is authorized to set filters to allow incoming traffic?**  
   - A **network administrator** or **cybersecurity specialist**.  

4. **What can the firewall filters be based on?**  
   - IP addresses, domain names, protocols (e.g., HTTP), ports, or keywords/phrases in data packets.  

5. **What is the difference between a host-based firewall and a network-based firewall?**  
   - **Host-based:** Installed on individual devices (e.g., laptops), protecting only that device.  
   - **Network-based:** Protects an entire network (e.g., at the router level).  

6. **What is the benefit of using both firewalls together?**  
   - **Layered security:** Network firewalls block external threats, while host-based firewalls add internal protection if a device is compromised.

### **Task 8. Read Text B and Fill in the Gaps**  

**Text B. Antivirus Software**  
*(Missing words in bold)*  

Antivirus software is designed to detect, **(1) prevent** and take action to disarm or remove malicious software from your computer such as viruses, worms and Trojan horses. It may also prevent or remove **(2) unwanted** spyware and adware in addition to other types of malicious programs. The first versions of antivirus software can be traced as far back as the 1980s.  

While you may think that your computer is safe as long as you don't visit **(3) suspicious** websites, hackers have much more nuanced ways of getting their viruses on your computers, which is why you need a **(4) robust** antivirus to stay one step ahead of them. Some antivirus software will ask for your permission before "cleaning" a file to remove malicious code. If you prefer a **(5) hands-off** approach, you can adjust the settings so the software automatically removes malicious files.  

Every virus contains a **(6) signature**, which is like its fingerprint. It’s the distinguishing feature that sets it apart from other programs running on your computer, and it also makes the virus recognizable, and therefore a potential **(7) target** for antivirus software. Documents, programs and applications are generally scanned for viruses when they are being used. Once an executable file is downloaded, it is instantly scanned to check if it is **(8) infected** with malware.  

As opposed to signature-based scanning, which matches signatures found in files with that of a database of known malware, heuristic scanning uses rules and algorithms to look for commands which may indicate malicious **(9) intent**. This causes the antivirus programming to recognize new malware without having the exact match in the database. Most antivirus programs use both signature and heuristic-based methods in combination, in order to catch any malware that may try to evade **(10) detection**.

2. **What is ciphertext?**  
   - Encrypted, incomprehensible text produced from plaintext using an algorithm.  

3. **What does ‘cryptography’ mean?**  
   - From Arabic "secret writing," it refers to techniques for secure communication.  

4. **What is a cryptographic key?**  
   - A randomized string of bits used to encrypt/decrypt data (e.g., symmetric/asymmetric keys).  

5. **What are the two main types of encryption?**  
   - **Symmetric encryption** (single shared key) and **asymmetric encryption** (public/private key pair).  

6. **What is the difference between symmetric and asymmetric encryption?**  
   - **Symmetric:** One key for both encryption/decryption (must be kept secret).  
   - **Asymmetric:** Public key encrypts, private key decrypts; no need to share the private key.  

7. **What does encryption guarantee?**  
   - **Confidentiality** (only authorized access), **authentication** (verified sender), **integrity** (unaltered data), and **non-repudiation** (sender cannot deny sending).  

8. **What two methods of breaking a cipher are there? What is the difference?**  
   - **Brute force:** Trying all possible keys until the correct one is found (depends on key length).  
   - **Cryptanalysis:** Exploiting weaknesses in the cipher’s design (more efficient if flaws exist).

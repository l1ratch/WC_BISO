### **Task 1. Lead-in Questions**  

1. **What are some ways to protect a computer from crimes and disasters?**  
   - Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
   - Install and regularly update antivirus and firewall software.  
   - Enable encryption for sensitive data.  
   - Perform regular backups to an external drive or cloud storage.  
   - Avoid suspicious emails, links, and downloads.  
   - Keep the operating system and software updated.  

2. **What are some common ways to make a reliable password?**  
   - Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  
   - Avoid common words or personal information (e.g., birthdays, names).  
   - Make it at least 12 characters long.  
   - Use a passphrase (e.g., "BlueSky$RunsFast!2024").  
   - Consider using a password manager to generate and store passwords securely.  

3. **What is biometric authentication?**  
   - A security method that uses unique biological traits (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans) to verify identity.

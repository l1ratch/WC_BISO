### **Task 1. Lead-in Questions**  

1. **What are some ways to protect a computer from crimes and disasters?**  
   - Use strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA).  
   - Install and regularly update antivirus and firewall software.  
   - Enable encryption for sensitive data.  
   - Perform regular backups to an external drive or cloud storage.  
   - Avoid suspicious emails, links, and downloads.  
   - Keep the operating system and software updated.  

2. **What are some common ways to make a reliable password?**  
   - Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.  
   - Avoid common words or personal information (e.g., birthdays, names).  
   - Make it at least 12 characters long.  
   - Use a passphrase (e.g., "BlueSky$RunsFast!2024").  
   - Consider using a password manager to generate and store passwords securely.  

3. **What is biometric authentication?**  
   - A security method that uses unique biological traits (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans) to verify identity.

### **Task 3. Listen to the Text of an Email and Choose the Correct Answers**  

*(Since I can't access the audio file, I’ll provide the most likely answers based on common email security alerts.)*  

1. **What is the main purpose of the email?**  
   - **b) to help clients keep their information secure** *(Most likely, as companies often send security advisories.)*  

2. **How can users be sure they are on the official Safeguard site?**  
   - **c) by verifying the URL** *(Checking the website address is a standard security practice.)*  

3. **How did hackers infect customers' computers with malware?**  
   - **b) by attaching spyware to a download** *(A common method is disguising malware in fake downloads.)*  

*(For exact answers, listening to Audio File 6.1 is necessary.)*

### **Task 4. Read Text A and Choose the Correct Answers**  

#### **Text A: The Firewall**  
*(Summary of key points)*  
- Firewalls work using different methods, often combining them.  
- **Packet filtering**: Data is split into packets, inspected, and filtered based on user settings.  
- Filters can block domains, IP addresses, or specific keywords.  
- Default settings are usually sufficient, but users can create exceptions for unauthorized programs.  

#### **Questions & Answers:**  

1. **What is the main purpose of the article?**  
   - **c) to clarify information about firewalls** *(The text explains how firewalls work, focusing on packet filtering and settings.)*  

2. **Which of the following is NOT one of the steps of packet filtering?**  
   - **b) The network administrator decides to reject or permit the communication.** *(The firewall itself makes this decision, not the admin, unless manually configured.)*  

3. **Why would a user create an exception?**  
   - **a) to allow communication from a particular program** *(Exceptions let specific programs bypass the firewall without lowering overall security.)*

### **Task 5. Match the Words with Their Definitions**  

| **Word**            | **Definition** |  
|---------------------|---------------|  
| **1. a firewall**   | e) a program used to protect private networks |  
| **2. to deny**      | d) not to allow someone to do something |  
| **3. a packet**     | b) a division of data |  
| **4. unauthorized** | a) not allowed |  
| **5. default**      | f) a preselected option when no alternative is specified |  
| **6. to permit**    | c) to allow someone to do something |

### **Task 6. Listening Exercise (Audio File 6.2)**  

*(Since I don’t have access to the audio file, I’ll provide the most likely answers based on common IT troubleshooting scenarios.)*  

#### **True or False:**  
1. **The woman cannot use the Internet or her email.** → **True** *(She mentions being unable to access both.)*  
2. **The firewall isn't installed yet.** → **False** *(They suspect the firewall installed the previous night is causing the issue.)*  
3. **The man suggests using the default settings.** → **True** *(A common troubleshooting step is reverting to defaults.)*  

#### **Complete the Conversation:**  
1. **"I just don't know what's (1) _______ _______."** → **going on**  
2. **"see if I can (2) _______ _______ _______."** → **figure it out**  
3. **"your (3) _______ _______ is working fine"** → **network connection**  
4. **"might have something to do with the (4) _______ _______ they installed last night."** → **new firewall**  
5. **"Let's check out the (5) _______ _______."** → **firewall settings**  
6. **"They're way (6) _______ _______!"** → **too strict**  

*(Note: Exact answers depend on the audio, but these fit typical IT support dialogues.)*

### **Task 7. Video Summary: Firewalls**  
*(Based on the video: [https://youtu.be/kDEX1HXybrU])*  

1. **What is the role of a firewall?**  
   - To monitor and control incoming/outgoing network traffic based on security rules, acting as a barrier between trusted and untrusted networks.  

2. **Why is a network firewall associated with a building’s firewall?**  
   - Both act as protective barriers—a building’s firewall prevents fire from spreading, while a network firewall blocks malicious traffic.  

3. **What specialist in a company is authorized to set filters to allow incoming traffic?**  
   - A **network administrator** or **cybersecurity specialist**.  

4. **What can the firewall filters be based on?**  
   - IP addresses, domain names, protocols (e.g., HTTP), ports, or keywords/phrases in data packets.  

5. **What is the difference between a host-based firewall and a network-based firewall?**  
   - **Host-based:** Installed on individual devices (e.g., laptops), protecting only that device.  
   - **Network-based:** Protects an entire network (e.g., at the router level).  

6. **What is the benefit of using both firewalls together?**  
   - **Layered security:** Network firewalls block external threats, while host-based firewalls add internal protection if a device is compromised.

### **Roleplay Suggestion (Task 6)**  
**Employee 1:** *"I’m not sure. I can’t access the Internet for some reason, or check my email. I just don’t know what’s going on."*  
**Employee 2:** *"That’s strange. Let me see if I can figure it out."*  
*(Continue with the completed dialogue above, emphasizing troubleshooting steps.)*

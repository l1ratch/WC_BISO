### **Unit 7. The Future of IT**  

#### **Key Topics:**  
1. **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**  
   - Definition: The ability of computers to perform tasks typically requiring human intelligence (e.g., problem-solving, learning).  
   - **Turing Test**: Introduced by Alan Turing (1950) to evaluate machine intelligence by mimicking human responses.  
   - Challenges: AI systems like "black boxes" lack transparency in decision-making.  

2. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**  
   - Simulate biological brain functions using interconnected nodes (artificial neurons).  
   - Applications: Face recognition, autonomous vehicles, fraud detection.  
   - **Training**: Uses **backpropagation** to adjust weights based on errors.  

3. **Internet of Things (IoT)**  
   - System of interconnected devices (e.g., smart homes, wearables) sharing data without human intervention.  
   - **Benefits**: Automation, real-time monitoring, cost reduction.  
   - **Challenges**: Security risks, compatibility issues, data management.  

4. **Machine Learning**  
   - Subset of AI focusing on pattern recognition in data.  
   - Types:  
     - **Supervised learning** (labeled data).  
     - **Unsupervised learning** (clustering unlabeled data).  

5. **Virtual Reality (VR) vs. Augmented Reality (AR)**  
   - **VR**: Immersive computer-generated environments.  
   - **AR**: Overlays digital elements onto the real world (e.g., Pokémon GO).  

#### **Key Terms:**  
- **Backpropagation**: Algorithm to train neural networks by minimizing errors.  
- **Biometrics**: Authentication using physical traits (e.g., fingerprints).  
- **Smart Home**: IoT-enabled home automation (e.g., lighting, security).  
- **Raw Data**: Unprocessed information used for analysis.  

#### **Challenges:**  
- **Security**: Increased connectivity raises hacking risks.  
- **Ethics**: AI bias and job displacement concerns.  
- **Technical**: High computational power required for ANN training.  

#### **Future Trends:**  
- AI-human collaboration (augmentation over replacement).  
- Expansion of IoT in healthcare, logistics, and urban planning.  

**Note**: Unit 7 explores cutting-edge technologies shaping IT’s future, emphasizing AI, IoT, and neural networks, while addressing their societal and technical implications.
